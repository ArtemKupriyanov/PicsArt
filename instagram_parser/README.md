### Quick Start to instaparser

1. We use instabot but with small changes in source code.
2. You should clone FapAdvisor/instabot directory from FapAdvisor git. 
3. Run following in bash:

```
cd instabot
python3 setup.py install
```

4. Now you have already installed our version of instabot.
5. We have created an account for parsing instagram. The credentials are in secret.txt file (there are login and encrypted password)
6. File instaparser.py contains functions to work with instagram.
